### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Diganta Misra](https://digantamisra98.github.io/), founder of a research group [Landskape](https://www.landskape.org/). I mostly focus on Abstract Algebra, Computer Vision, Mean Field Theory, Convex Optimization, Deep Learning Theory and Non-Linear Dynamics. 

### News:

- Our preprint for [Rotate to Attend: Convolutional Triplet Attention Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03045) is out on ArXiv. Congrats to my co-authors, [Trikay Nalamada (IIT-G)](https://github.com/trikaynalamada), [Ajay Uppili Arasanipalai(UIUC)](https://iyaja.github.io/) and [Qibin Hou(NUS)](https://andrew-qibin.github.io/homepage/).
